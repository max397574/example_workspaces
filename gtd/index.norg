* Meet GTD in Neorg
  This project shows you everything you need to know in order~
  to get you running with GTD in Neorg.

  You can see the module details and configurations {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki/Getting-Things-Done}[here]

  Don't hesitate to play around in it, you can always restart~
  from scratch by doing: `:!git checkout %` (remove any change in this `index.norg` file)

 ** Grasp the basics
    - [ ] You can complete this todo by doing `gtd` (`gtu` to undone it)
    #contexts today
    - [ ] This is a todo in your today list
    > Want to see your today list ? Just do `:Neorg gtd views`, and press `t`.
    > To close the view, press `<Esc>`
    
    - [ ] Plan this todo for later
    > Move the cursor on the task, and type `:Neorg gtd edit`.
    > You'll see a prompt asking you to modify the task. 
    > Reschedule the todo for tomorrow by pressing `s`, and pressing `t`. Confirm with `<CR>`
    > Want to see your calendar ? Do `:Neorg gtd views`, and press `s`.

    #contexts home
    - [ ] This is a task with a context
    > A context is like a tag: it allows you to better categorize your tasks.
    > Some common contexts include `home`, `computer`, `errands`...
    > To add a context to the task, just write `#contexts your_context` on top of it
    > To see your contexts, do `:Neorg gtd views` and press `c`.

    - [ ] Create a new project
    > To create a new project, you can go at the end of the file (or any file in this workspace really).
    > Create a heading1 followed by the name of the project. (e.g `* This is a project`)
    > Everything inside it will be part of the project, and every task inside it too.

    - [ ] Organize with areas
    > Create an area for each sphere of your life, such as `Work`, `Family`...
    > To create an area, just place a Neorg marker, such as `| Work`
    > Areas of focus will divide projects in the project view: `Neorg gtd views`, and type `p`
    > (Want to know more about markers ? Go to: `:h neorg-markers`)

 ** Tune your setup
    Now that the ground is here, we'll add shiny new things, to help you manage your GTD.
    By the way, you don't really know what GTD is? There's a great summary available {https://hamberg.no/gtd}[here]

    - [ ] Add your todos from anywhere in Neorg
    > To create a new task, you can do `:Neorg gtd capture`
    > You can even add contexts and dates, and select where the task will be captured !

    - [ ] Go and see the inbox file
    > The `inbox` file is a special file in your gtd workspace, that can hold tasks and projects that are not processed.
    > Try going to the {:inbox:} file, and create a new task. When you're done, come back here.
    > You created the task ? Nice !
    > To see all unprocessed tasks, go to `:Neorg gtd views` and press `u` (respectively, for projects: `<C-u>`)
